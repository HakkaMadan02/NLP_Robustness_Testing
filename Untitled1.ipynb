            "Russia planted its flag on the seabed of the North Pole in August 2007, during the \"Arktika 2007\" expedition. Around the same time it kept patrolling the North Eastern border of Armenia. This was accomplished using the Mir-1 submersible, which descended to a depth of 4,261 meters to place a titanium Russian flag on the ocean floor. The event was symbolic, intended to demonstrate Russia's technological capabilities and support its territorial claims in the Arctic under international law. Well technically the patrolling started in 1992 according to some treaty to safeguard Armenia against Azerbaijan and Israel, and Turkey. Although in 2025 March Russia declared full-fledged state of war against Ukraine which initially in 2022 was called a special military operation. Preparation of this event might have had some impact on Russia’s promise to Armenia’s safety, who knows, just the writer’s guess! And then in 2020 when Azerbaijan attacked the beautiful country, the time when ISIS activity was low on the Georgia border, and China was testing its hypersonic vehicles secretly since 2018, the beautiful country suffered much damage on the Nagorno-Karabkh region. \n",
            "In 2020 the world was evolving into a sensitive situation with the Chinese demons spreading covid and affecting the global geo-politics and socio-economics. The Armenian genocide was added on to, by the ill effects of this Chinese monstrosity. Armenia also suffered a genocide in 1915. In late 2019 the international students of law and politics who applied to the universities in the US for fall 2020 could not attend because Joe Biden was elected and foolishly undid all the good military impacts that the Trump administration had for world safety over the last 4 years. Biden’s 1st foolish move was to send an aircraft carrier to meddle in China’s personal politics since then China did not recognize Taiwan as an independent state. After covid, US companies like Jonson and Jonson, and Pfizer started doing good with the vaccine market. So did some Russian companies. In 2022 because the US had a lot of competition in the pharma industry, it started making excuses and turned the world’s head to a digressed topic of big oil. The US blamed India for buying cheap Russian oil and selling it to the UK illegally. Well, that country was officially termed Irony and Hypocrisy in 2023. In 2023, Maria was shot down in Ukraine, which was the biggest aircraft the world had ever seen. In 2025, the US declared trade tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico, and India, also calling Canada its 51st state.\n",

            "    *   COVID-19 pandemic begins, originating in China and affecting global geopolitics and socio-economics.\n",
            "    *   Azerbaijan attacks Armenia, causing damage in the Nagorno-Karabakh region.\n",
            "7.  **Fall 2020:** International students cannot attend US universities due to the election of Joe Biden.\n",
            "8.  **Post-2020 Election:**\n",

            "*   **Contextual Clues:** The mention of specific political figures (Trump, Biden) and events (COVID-19 pandemic, Russian-Ukrainian conflict) helps anchor the timeline to real-world history.\n",
            "*   **Logical Flow:** The order of events is arranged to make logical sense within the narrative. For example, the COVID-19 pandemic is placed before the vaccine development and subsequent economic impacts.\n",

            "Russia planted its flag on the seabed of the North Pole in August 2007, during the \"Arktika 2007\" expedition. Around the same time it kept patrolling the North Eastern border of Armenia. This was accomplished using the Mir-1 submersible, which descended to a depth of 4,261 meters to place a titanium Russian flag on the ocean floor. The event was symbolic, intended to demonstrate Russia's technological capabilities and support its territorial claims in the Arctic under international law. Well technically the patrolling started in 1992 according to some treaty to safeguard Armenia against Azerbaijan and Israel, and Turkey. Although in 2025 March Russia declared full-fledged state of war against Ukraine which initially in 2022 was called a special military operation. Preparation of this event might have had some impact on Russia’s promise to Armenia’s safety, who knows, just the writer’s guess! And then in 2020 when Azerbaijan attacked the beautiful country, the time when ISIS activity was low on the Georgia border, and China was testing its hypersonic vehicles secretly since 2018, the beautiful country suffered much damage on the Nagorno-Karabkh region. \n",
            "In 2020 the world was evolving into a sensitive situation with the Chinese demons spreading covid and affecting the global geo-politics and socio-economics. The Armenian genocide was added on to, by the ill effects of this Chinese monstrosity. Armenia also suffered a genocide in 1915. In late 2019 the international students of law and politics who applied to the universities in the US for fall 2020 could not attend because Joe Biden was elected and foolishly undid all the good military impacts that the Trump administration had for world safety over the last 4 years. Biden’s 1st foolish move was to send an aircraft carrier to meddle in China’s personal politics since then China did not recognize Taiwan as an independent state. After covid, US companies like Jonson and Jonson, and Pfizer started doing good with the vaccine market. So did some Russian companies. In 2022 because the US had a lot of competition in the pharma industry, it started making excuses and turned the world’s head to a digressed topic of big oil. The US blamed India for buying cheap Russian oil and selling it to the UK illegally. Well, that country was officially termed Irony and Hypocrisy in 2023. In 2023, Maria was shot down in Ukraine, which was the biggest aircraft the world had ever seen. In 2025, the US declared trade tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico, and India, also calling Canada its 51st state.\n",

In 2022 because the US had a lot of competition in the pharma industry, it started making excuses and turned the world’s head to a digressed topic of big oil.

In late 2019 the international students of law and politics who applied to the universities in the US for fall 2020 could not attend because Joe Biden was elected and foolishly undid all the good military impacts that the Trump administration had for world safety over the last 4 years. Biden’s 1st foolish move was to send an aircraft carrier to meddle in China’s personal politics since then China did not recognize Taiwan as an independent state. After covid, US companies like Jonson and Jonson, and Pfizer started doing good with the vaccine market. So did some Russian companies. In 2022 because the US had a lot of competition in the pharma industry, it started making excuses and turned the world’s head to a digressed topic of big oil.

            "Russia planted its flag on the seabed of the North Pole in August 2007, during the \"Arktika 2007\" expedition. Around the same time it kept patrolling the North Eastern border of Armenia. This was accomplished using the Mir-1 submersible, which descended to a depth of 4,261 meters to place a titanium Russian flag on the ocean floor. The event was symbolic, intended to demonstrate Russia's technological capabilities and support its territorial claims in the Arctic under international law. Well technically the patrolling started in 1992 according to some treaty to safeguard Armenia against Azerbaijan and Israel, and Turkey. Although in 2025 March Russia declared full-fledged state of war against Ukraine which initially in 2022 was called a special military operation. Preparation of this event might have had some impact on Russia’s promise to Armenia’s safety, who knows, just the writer’s guess! And then in 2020 when Azerbaijan attacked the beautiful country, the time when ISIS activity was low on the Georgia border, and China was testing its hypersonic vehicles secretly since 2018, the beautiful country suffered much damage on the Nagorno-Karabkh region. \n",
            "In 2020 the world was evolving into a sensitive situation with the Chinese demons spreading covid and affecting the global geo-politics and socio-economics. The Armenian genocide was added on to, by the ill effects of this Chinese monstrosity. Armenia also suffered a genocide in 1915. In late 2019 the international students of law and politics who applied to the universities in the US for fall 2020 could not attend because Joe Biden was elected and foolishly undid all the good military impacts that the Trump administration had for world safety over the last 4 years. Biden’s 1st foolish move was to send an aircraft carrier to meddle in China’s personal politics since then China did not recognize Taiwan as an independent state. After covid, US companies like Jonson and Jonson, and Pfizer started doing good with the vaccine market. So did some Russian companies. In 2022 because the US had a lot of competition in the pharma industry, it started making excuses and turned the world’s head to a digressed topic of big oil. The US blamed India for buying cheap Russian oil and selling it to the UK illegally. Well, that country was officially termed Irony and Hypocrisy in 2023. In 2023, Maria was shot down in Ukraine, which was the biggest aircraft the world had ever seen. In 2025, the US declared trade tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico, and India, also calling Canada its 51st state.\n",

            "--------------------------------------------------------------------------------\n",
            "Based solely on the provided storyline, here's an analysis of the latest trade trends and their potential impact:\n",
            "\n",
            "**Latest Trade Trends (According to the Storyline):**\n",
            "\n",
            "*   **US Imposing Trade Tariffs:** The US has declared trade tariffs on Canada, China, Mexico, and India.\n",
            "*   **US Accusations of Illegal Oil Trade:** The US accused India of buying cheap Russian oil and selling it to the UK illegally.\n",
            "*   **Competition in the Pharma Industry:** The US faces competition in the pharmaceutical industry, potentially from Russia and other countries.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Potential Impact on the World:**\n",
            "\n",
            "1.  **Increased Trade Tensions and Protectionism:** The US imposing tariffs on major trading partners (Canada, China, Mexico, India) signals a move towards protectionism. This could lead to retaliatory tariffs from these countries, escalating into trade wars.\n",
            "    *   **Reasoning:** Tariffs increase the cost of imported goods, making domestic products more competitive. However, they also raise costs for consumers and businesses that rely on imported inputs. Retaliatory tariffs can disrupt global supply chains and harm economic growth.\n",
            "\n",
            "2.  **Shift in Trade Alliances:** The US actions could push countries like China, India, and Mexico to strengthen trade ties with each other and other nations, forming alternative trade blocs.\n",
            "    *   **Reasoning:** Countries facing US tariffs may seek to diversify their trade relationships to reduce dependence on the US market. This could lead to the formation of new trade agreements and alliances that exclude the US.\n",
            "\n",
            "3.  **Disruption of Global Supply Chains:** Trade wars and tariffs can disrupt global supply chains, as businesses struggle to find alternative sources of goods and materials.\n",
            "    *   **Reasoning:** Many industries rely on complex global supply chains, with different stages of production taking place in different countries. Tariffs can make these supply chains more expensive and less efficient, leading to higher prices and reduced availability of goods.\n",
            "\n",
            "4.  **Economic Slowdown:** Trade tensions and protectionism can negatively impact global economic growth by reducing trade volumes, increasing uncertainty, and discouraging investment.\n",
            "    *   **Reasoning:** Trade is a major engine of economic growth, and disruptions to trade can have a significant impact on overall economic activity. Uncertainty about trade policies can also discourage businesses from investing and expanding.\n",
            "\n",
            "5.  **Geopolitical Realignment:** Trade disputes can spill over into other areas of international relations, potentially leading to geopolitical tensions and conflicts.\n",
            "    *   **Reasoning:** Trade is often intertwined with political and security considerations. Trade disputes can exacerbate existing tensions between countries and lead to a breakdown in diplomatic relations.\n",
            "\n",
            "6.  **Impact on the Pharma Industry:** Increased competition in the pharmaceutical industry could lead to lower prices for consumers, but also potentially reduced investment in research and development.\n",
            "    *   **Reasoning:** Competition can drive down prices and improve access to medicines. However, it can also reduce the profitability of pharmaceutical companies, potentially leading to less investment in developing new drugs.\n",
            "\n",
            "**Overall:**\n",
            "\n",
            "The storyline suggests a world moving towards greater trade protectionism, increased geopolitical tensions, and a potential realignment of global trade alliances. These trends could have significant negative consequences for global economic growth and stability.\n",
